# Root Exploits

This page contains a general summary of root exploits/exploit chains published
for webOS at some point.

| dejavuln | 2024/04/20 | 2024/05/?? | Mitigated in firmware update |
| NVM Debug Mode | 2023/01/18 | - | Applies only to webOS 3.x and older, requires hardware mod |
| faultmanager | 2024/01/04 | - | Applies to webOS 3.5 and newer |

Vulnerabilities listed as **mitigated in firmware update** should be exploitable
if device is running sufficiently old firmware version.

Vulnerabilities listed as **mitigated in system app update** should be
exploitable if device is running sufficiently old firmware version and exploit
is carried out before letting the device contact LG services. (responsible for
system apps updates)

Vulnerabilities listed as **mitigated in devmode jail config update** are
unlikely to be exploitable. (since devmode needs to be refreshed, and that requires
network connection, and thus - leads to a jail config update)

## GetMeIn
One of the first public LG webOS root exploit chains, originally published on
[xda-developers](https://xdaforums.com/t/getmein-one-time-rooting-jailbreaking-tool-for-webos-lg-tvs.3887904/).

Misconfigured devmode jail config allowed for direct system memory read/write
(`/dev/mem`) on certain platforms.

For a long time people were convinced this was fully patched, though only
in 2024/04 LG finally patched a bug in devmode jail config that allowed rollbacks
(that was published sometime in late 2023, see `crashd` exploit guide linked
below) and thus kept this exploitable.

## RootMyTV v1
Single-click root exploit chain based on a [published arbitrary file write
~~vulnerability~~ feature](https://blog.recurity-labs.com/2021-02-03/webOS_Pt1.html). Summary of an
exploit chain available in [RootMyTV repo](https://github.com/RootMyTV/RootMyTV.github.io).

Broken mitigation (download whitelists) rolled out in firmware update was worked around in v2.

`start-devmode.sh` used as a root code exection hook is now signed (thus can't
be used anymore) and presence of an unsigned/mis-signed file breaks developer
mode.

## RootMyTV v2
Updated version of RootMyTV. Summary present in [RootMyTV
repo](https://github.com/RootMyTV/RootMyTV.github.io) readme contains
description of changes introduced in v2.

`extra_conf.sh` used as root code execution hook was removed in a firmware
update.

## crashd
Command injection bug in `clouduploadd` service originally discovered and [published on
webosforums.ru by whiterat](https://webos-forums.ru/post155471.html#p155471).

Full [guide by throwaway96](https://gist.github.com/throwaway96/e811b0f7cc2a705a5a476a8dfa45e09f) was published.

Underlying vulnerability in clouduploadd was independently discovered by
[Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/vulnerabilities-identified-in-lg-webos/) and assigned CVE-2023-6318.

## WTA
USB file-based backdoor - see [guide by throwaway96](https://gist.github.com/throwaway96/b171240ef59d7f5fd6fb48fc6dfd2941).

Discovered a long time ago by [Mariotaku](https://github.com/mariotaku) (2021/05/29, OpenLGTV team),
though only published after patch started getting rolled out.

Independently discovered and reported by
[redfr0g](https://www.brzozowski.io/web-applications/2024/04/09/lg-webos-pwnage-getting-rce-on-signage-tvs.html) and assigned CVE-2024-1886.

## asm command injection
Command injection in `com.webos.service.attachedstoragemanager/getAudioMetadata`
(`asm` service) was discovered, reported and patched before publishing
by [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/labs/vulnerabilities-identified-in-lg-webos/), assigned CVE-2023-6319.

Exploit for this vulnerability was [published by
ixion](https://github.com/illixion/root-my-webos-tv).

## dejavuln
Essentially the same vulnerable code as in `asm` service listed above was
present in `cbox`. This was discovered by [Jacob
Clayden](https://jacobcx.dev/) and published by
throwaway96 as [dejavuln-autoroot](https://github.com/throwaway96/dejavuln-autoroot).

## NVM Debug Mode
Debug mode built into webOS allows for root code execution over serial. Debug
mode flag was stored on unencrypted/unsigned EEPROM on platforms before 2018
(webOS 3.x).

A guide on how to identify the EEPROM and apply relevant changes was
[published by
throwaway96](https://gist.github.com/throwaway96/827ff726981cc2cbc46a22a2ad7337a1).

## faultmanager
Exploit chain utilizing a vulnerability in the faultmanager service. Published by
throwaway96 as [faultmanager-autoroot](https://github.com/throwaway96/faultmanager-autoroot).
Applies to webOS 3.5 and newer versions.
