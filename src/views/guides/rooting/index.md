# Rooting

## Why Root?

### Install Apps without Developer Mode

Installing apps without root requires enabling developer mode. It needs a developer account, and has a timer that
deletes apps after 1000 hours. Rooting allows you to install apps without developer mode.

### Gain More Control

You can install custom screensavers, set up DIY ambient lighting, and more.

### Free Up Space

Some models have store demo videos preloaded. They could take up to 500MB of space. Rooting allows you to delete them.

## Risks of Rooting

Before rooting, make sure you understand the risks:

### Warranty

Rooting _may_ void your warranty. We're not responsible for any damage caused.

### Bricking Risk

Rooting via software methods is generally safe and usually has no consequences if it fails.

However, making system changes without proper knowledge or ignoring [warnings](https://rootmy.tv/warning) can
damage (brick) your TV.

### Security Issues

Rooting allows you to enable SSH and Telnet. If your TV is exposed to the internet, hackers could gain access -
especially when you have Telnet enabled, which has no password protection.

### Firmware Updates & Factory Reset

Rooting usually remains after firmware updates. However, if you perform a factory reset and lose root access, you may
not be able to root your TV again.
